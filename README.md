# Loan Default Prediction with Machine Learning

This project is an end-to-end case study focused on predicting loan defaults using classification models. It includes the complete machine learning pipeline: data loading and cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning. Both logistic regression and random forest classifiers are implemented and compared.

A key challenge addressed in the project is class imbalanceâ€”defaults represent only ~21% of the dataset. Several strategies were applied to handle this, including class weighting (`balanced` and manual), resampling (upsampling/downsampling), and synthetic oversampling (SMOTE). Model performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices. The best performing model was a downsampled random forest, which provided improved recall while maintaining reasonable precision and interpretability.

## Requirements

## Outcome
By iterating through multiple balancing and modeling techniques, the study demonstrates how thoughtful preprocessing and evaluation can significantly enhance classification performance in imbalanced datasets.
